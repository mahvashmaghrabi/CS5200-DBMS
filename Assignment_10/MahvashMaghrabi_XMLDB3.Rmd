# Q1) UML diagram that satisfies the Boycee Codd Normal Form

# Q2) Creating and Connecting to a new SQLite database for the books data in the XML file
```{r}
newdb <- "bookBank.db"
conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(newdb))
```

# Creating a new table Book in the database created
```{sql connection=conn}
CREATE TABLE Book( 
  book_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  author TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  genre TEXT,
  price NUMBER,
  publish_date DATE,
  description TEXT
)

# Q3) Loading the XML data from the file into R data frames.
```{r}
log <- xmlRoot(ReadXML)
size <- xmlSize(log)
```

# Processing Node Lists
```{r}
authorData <- xpathApply(log, "//author")
titleData <- xpathApply(log, "//title")
genreData <- xpathApply(log, "//genre")
priceData <- xpathApply(log, "//price")
dateData <- xpathApply(log, "//publish_date")
descriptionData <- xpathApply(log, "//description")

```

# Dataframes for storing the data
```{r}
catalog.df <- data.frame(book_id = vector (mode = "character", len = size),
    author = vector (mode = "character", len = size),
    title = vector (mode = "character",len = size),
    genre = vector (mode = "character",len = size),
    price = vector (mode = "integer", len = size),
    publish_date = vector (mode = "character",len = size),
    description = vector (mode = "character",len = size))
```

# Iterating through the elements in XML
```{r}
for (book in 1:size)
{
  
  bk <- log[[book]]
  bkAttribute <- xmlAttrs(bk)
  book_idAttribute <- bkAttribute[1]
  
  catalog.df$book_id[book] <- book_idAttribute

#Q4) Saving the dataframes to the data table
```{r}
dbWriteTable(conn, "Book", catalog.df, overwrite = T)
```

# Simple SELECT query to check the database
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT * FROM Book
```
#Q5)SQL Queries
# A) What is the number of genres have at least three books?
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT genre) as "TOTAL GENRES" 
FROM Book 
WHERE genre 
IN (SELECT genre FROM Book GROUP BY genre HAVING COUNT(genre) > 3)
```

# B) What is the oldest year in which a publication was published?
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT substr(publish_date, 1, 4) AS "OLDEST YEAR" 
FROM Book 
ORDER BY publish_date ASC LIMIT 1
```

# C) Find the number of books and average price for each genre.
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT genre AS "GENRE", COUNT(DISTINCT book_id) AS "NUMBER OF BOOKS", AVG(price) AS "AVERAGE PRICE"
FROM Book 
GROUP BY genre
```

# D)List the title and author of all books that are less than 0.8*AVG or more than 1.2*AVG, where AVG is the average price of all books.

```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT title AS "TITLE", author AS "AUTHOR"
From Book 
WHERE price < (.8 * (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book)) OR price > (1.2 * (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book))

```
# Disconnect the database
```{r}
dbDisconnect(conn)
```
